Summary
On June 10, 2024, our web stack experienced a critical outage affecting service availability for a significant portion of our users. The outage lasted for 2 hours and 30 minutes, impacting approximately 30% of our users. The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, which led to an imbalance in traffic distribution and subsequent cascading failures across backend services.

Duration of the Outage
Start Time: June 10, 2024, 10:00 AM UTC
End Time: June 10, 2024, 12:30 PM UTC
Total Duration: 2 hours and 30 minutes
Issue Detection
Detection Time: June 10, 2024, 10:05 AM UTC
How Detected: The issue was detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating high error rates and increased response times on key services. Shortly after, multiple customer complaints were received, confirming the service disruption.
Actions Taken
Initial Investigation:

System Components Investigated: Load balancer configurations, server logs, authentication service, and database performance metrics.
Assumptions on Root Cause: Initial assumptions included potential DDoS attack, database overload, or issues with a recent deployment.
Misleading Debugging Paths:

Database Overload: Initial focus was on the database, suspecting it might be overwhelmed. However, database performance metrics were within normal parameters.
DDoS Attack: Considered the possibility of a DDoS attack but ruled out after network traffic analysis showed no abnormal patterns.
Correct Path:

Shifted focus to the load balancer configurations after ruling out other components.
Detailed examination of recent configuration changes revealed the misconfiguration.
Incident Escalation:

Escalated To: The incident was escalated to the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team and the network engineering team.
Individuals Involved: Lead SRE, network engineer, backend service engineers, and the incident response manager.
Resolution
Immediate Actions:

Corrected the misconfiguration in the load balancer settings.
Gradually restarted affected services in a controlled manner to redistribute traffic evenly.
Closely monitored the system to ensure all services were functioning correctly.
Follow-Up Actions:

Conducted a thorough post-mortem to understand the root cause and impact fully.
Implemented enhanced monitoring and automated alerts for load balancer configurations.
Updated documentation and provided additional training to the engineering team on the new load balancer features.
Preventive Measures
Configuration Management: Regular audits of configuration settings, especially post-deployment.
Enhanced Monitoring: Implementation of automated alerts for unusual traffic patterns and server load imbalances.
Staging Environment: Rigorous testing of load balancer configurations in a staging environment before production deployment.
Team Training: Updated training for engineering teams on new load balancer features and best practices.
Conclusion
The outage on June 10, 2024, highlighted the critical need for meticulous configuration management and comprehensive testing in a controlled environment. By implementing the outlined preventive measures, we aim to reduce the risk of similar incidents in the future, ensuring a more reliable and resilient web stack infrastructure.
